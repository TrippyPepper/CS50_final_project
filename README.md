# CS50_final_project

PSET 10 of CS50x - Harvard. The final project is anything that I want to do, an app, a website, a game, etc. Hope this goes well.


My plan right now is to make a website that dishes out information about your last name and your birthday. Either using information on sites like "https://www.onthisday.com/" to learn things that happened on your birthday or #1 song at the time, "https://www.famousbirthdays.com/" to learn who shares your birthday. "https://www.familysearch.org/en/surname" for last name information.

 Pretty simple, but fun to have multiple different sites with different informations all at the same place. Maybe I can import the "text-boxes" of the sites and then prints the information, or i ask for a user input and transform that information into a url that will research and bring back information. 

 Might use flask like CS50 Fiannce to use a website data and bring it back to my website? might have other solutions because i do not know how it works rn
